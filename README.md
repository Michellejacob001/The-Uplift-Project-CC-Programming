# The Uplift Project - C and C++ Programming

### Project Domain - Education
## Project Name - University Management System
The University Management System handles all information necessary for handling a college, student and professor.

Project will be handled with oops concept and file handling

The University management system project maintains the list of affiliated colleges and their different streams. It also maintains the examination and the result department with a proper menu system. It maintains the details of the professors and other staff as well.
